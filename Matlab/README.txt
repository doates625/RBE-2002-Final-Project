INTRODUCTION

This folder contains all the Matlab code used for the robot UI.

INSTRUCTIONS

The UI can be run by adding this folder to the Matlab path at running the script <RobotConsole.m>. The UI (figure 1) should snap to the right half of the screen, so it is best to drag the Matlab IDE to the left half so both can be viewed simultaneously. To view a replay of one of the robot's missions, press the "Replay" button on the UI after starting the script. The robot's position and field map will generate in the figure plot while text describing the robot's position, state, and mission status will display in the Matlab IDE. The speed of the replay relative to real time depends on the specs of the computer running it, as no time data was collected from the robot.
