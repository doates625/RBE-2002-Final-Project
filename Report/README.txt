INTRODUCTION

This folder contains the final report submitted by my team.

REPORT ERRORS

Because my team members didn't finish their report sections until 4am before the 8am deadline, I was not given an opportunity to proofread it as a whole for organization and cleanliness. There were a few errors in moving my sections to the main report that I was unable to correct:

1. Sections 2.6 and 2.7 (see TOC) should have been sub-sections of 2.5 (Drive Control).

2. The last paragraph of 2.7 should have been a separate sub-section of 2.5 titled "Notes on Series PID Controllers".

3. In section 2.8 (Matlab Software), each figure after Figure 7 was originally a cropped section of Figure 7, but transfer errors between Google Docs and Microsoft Word undid the cropping and resulted in distorted versions of the full Figure 7 instead.

4. Section 3.6 (Implementation of Odometry in C++) should have been a sub-section of 3.5 (Odometry Algorithm) and is mis-labeled as "3.4" in the report body.

MY SECTIONS

Below are the sections and figures I contributed. The names are as they appear in the TOC (not the body, as discussed above).
